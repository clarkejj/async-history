This is a presentation + code-project for PyYYC November, 2017

Code Assignment:

 - list all py-yyc repos
   https://api.github.com/orgs/py-yyc/repos
 - bonus: list most-recent first
 - discover the SHA1 of the most-recent commit of each repo
   https://api.github.com/repos/py-yyc/{repo}/commits
 - bonus: retrieve these in parallel

Rough Overview:

 - review: kurt's June presentation
 - Twisted (2002 ..)
 - @inlineCallbacks and yield (2006)
 - asyncio (2013 ..)

 - link to kurt's June presentation
   - 'quick review' of ^ (in 1 or 2 slides)
     - cores vs. threads
     - context-switches cost time
     - io-bound vs cpu-bound
   - 'event-based programming'
     - incoming events trigger "callbacks"
     - callbacks do small amount of processing and trigger other events
       (e.g. send a network packet, queue some work, etc)
 - Twisted 2002
     - release 1.0: 2002 (http://twistedmatrix.com/pipermail/twisted-python/2002-October/002049.html)
     - youtube started 2005
     - Deferred()
   - ancient times: Deferred
     - "callback" and "errback" functions registered
     - can be 'chained'
     - Deferred is either "called" or "not called"
     - no need for an event-loop!
   - event-loop
     - twisted supports many OS event-loops
     - poll, epoll, select, WaitForMultipleObjects, IOCP, KQueue, CoreFoundation
     - can interoperate w/ many GUI event-loops
   - event-loop
     - glues network and OS events to callbacks
     - e.g. "dataReceived(data)" whenever a socket is read()-able
   - example: connect to a server
 - Twisted 2006: @inlineCallbacks + yield
 - 2009: "yield from"
 - asyncio: 2013
 - asyncio: "async def", "await"
 - Twisted: "async def", "await"
